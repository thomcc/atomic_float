/// A floating point type which can be safely shared between threads.
///
/// This type has the same in-memory representation as the underlying floating
/// point type, [`f32`].
///
/// See the module documentation for [core::sync::atomic] for information about
/// the portability of various atomics (this one is mostly as portable as
/// [`AtomicU32`](core::sync::atomic::AtomicU32), with the caveat that we
/// additionally that the platform support 32-bit floats).
///
/// # Example
///
/// The intended use case is situations like this:
///
/// ```
/// # use atomic_float::AtomicF32;
/// # use std::sync::atomic::Ordering;
/// static DELTA_TIME: AtomicF32 = AtomicF32::new(1.0);
///
/// // In some main simulation loop:
/// # fn compute_delta_time() -> f32 { 1.0 / 60.0 }
/// DELTA_TIME.store(compute_delta_time(), Ordering::Release);
///
/// // elsewhere, perhaps on other threads:
/// let dt = DELTA_TIME.load(Ordering::Acquire);
/// // Use `dt` to compute simulation...
/// ```
///
/// As well as any other cases where use of locking would be too substantial of
/// overhead.
///
/// Note that when used like this (with Acquire and Release orderings), on
/// x86_64 this compiles to the same code as you would get from a C++ global,
/// (or a Rust `static mut`), while offering full synchronization.
///
/// (While caveats exist, the cases where you'd need the total order guaranteed
/// by [SeqCst](core::sync::atomic::Ordering::SeqCst) for something like
/// [`AtomicF32`] seem very rare).
///
/// # Implementation
///
/// Note: These details are not part of the stability guarantee of this crate,
/// and are subject to change without a semver-breaking change.
///
/// Under the hood we use a transparent `UnsafeCell<f32>`, and cast the
/// `&UnsafeCell<f32>` to an [`&AtomicU32`](core::sync::atomic::AtomicU32) in
/// order to perform atomic operations.
///
/// This means that we have the same ABI and layout as f32, and that some
/// operations have a minimal cost (for example: on x86 all operations of
/// equivalent or weaker ordering than `Release` stores/`Acquire` loads are
/// essentially equivalent to non-atomic f32).
///
/// However, operations like [`fetch_add`](AtomicF32::fetch_add) are
/// considerably slower than would be the case for integer atomics.

    /// [`compare_exchange_weak`], ...) and the notion of bitwise identicality
    /// which they require being somewhat problematic for NaNs, especially on
    /// targets like Wasm (see [rust-lang/rust#73328]).
    ///
    /// [`compare_and_swap`]: AtomicU32::compare_and_swap

    /// In general despite how bad this might sound, in practice we're fairly
    /// safe: LLVM almost never optimizes through atomic operations, this

    /// usage, and I'm optimistic the situation will clean itself up in the
    /// short-to-medium-term future.

    /// However, if you need peace of mind, or find yourself in a case where you
    /// suspect you're hitting this issue, you can access the underlying atomic
    /// value using this function.

    /// # use std::sync::atomic::Ordering;
